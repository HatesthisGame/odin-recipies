Hatesthisgame's Recipie Website

This website will demonstrate that I can 
1)make a functional (but oh so ugly) website
2)spread my vegan propaganda digitally
3)use Git and commits well enough to be hired

By creating this I will demonstrate my ability to code in html, my ability to
create and use back ups, and hopefully impress my sweet girlfriend with my 
web making skills.
